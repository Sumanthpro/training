- git Rebase - combines commits together , can also delete the commits and revert will change the commit msg.(squash,delete,revert)

- the point of doing rebase is to keep the commit in straight line
  i.e(to maintain the hsitroy in the straight line)

using binary search i.e means split the commit line into half and then searching would be easier by dividing it using binary search

> command for do is --- git bisect

> git pull --rebase origin branch_name(dev) -- runs this command daily to pull the changes from dev to feature

# Terminologies used in professional life

- System -code or product which we are devloping is called system.(for it people)

- COnfiguration Item(CI)-- deals with your git i.e files

- Release management -- branching strategies -- master branch for customer ,staging for testing, dev for developers.CI/CD(continues integration and continous deployement) -- deploy master to netlify.
