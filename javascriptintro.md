# Introduction to Java Script

1. Data type declaration in js is not necessary

2. To find the what type of data type the variable is we use

   ```js
   Syntax: typeof var_name;
   ```

   example:

   ```js
   typeof name;
   string;
   ```

3. In javascripts the dictioneries are called as objects
4. student.name & student['name'] will give same output
5. variable declaration:

   ```js
   var stud_name="sumanth"

   var student={
    name: "sumanth"
    age: 20
    comp : "proclink"
   }
   ```

   # Types of delcarations

   ```js
   var- can be reassigned, and redeclared
   let - cannot be reassiagned for redeclared
   const - both are not possible
   ```

   Example:

   ```js
   var name=ravi;
   let name;//it gives error
   const surname;//it can't be changed
   ```

   # Data Types

```js
typeof t;
object;
typeof 4.5;
number;
typeof array;
```

# How to print

```js
console.log(student[name]);
```
